# LED-Neon-Sign
An LED neon sign that I made using a laser cutter, soldering, and radio signals.

## About this project
After my first semester at Georgia Tech, I realized that my dorm room could use some decor and needed some extra lighting. To fix both issues with one solution, I designed and made a neon sign out of an LED strip.

## Designing the sign
To make this sign, the first thing I did was design the outline of the sign using Inkscape, a vector graphics software. I used the Bezier curve tool to trace over a popular album cover design that I wanted to recreate and then converted the strokes to paths in order to provide the laser cutter with information as to where to cut.

## Using the laser cutter
To actually cut this out, I used corrugated cardboard as the base material and reinforced it with wood glue. I then placed the sheet in the laser cutter and filled in the sides of the cut shape with scrap cardboard at the makerspace and painted the entire frame black to give it a nice finish. 

## Adding in the lights
When adding in the LED light strip, I first cut segments of the light to fit in with the design. Then, I soldered 4" connection points to the leads on the LED strips which allowed me to run the wires through the frame and into the back of the frame. From there, I soldered the leads together and connected the lights back to the power supply.
