# LED-Neon-Sign
An LED neon sign that I made using a laser cutter, soldering, and radio signals.

## About this project
After my first semester at Georgia Tech, I realized that my dorm room could use some decor and needed some extra lighting. To fix both issues with one solution, I designed and made a neon sign out of an LED strip.

## Designing the sign
To make this sign, the first thing I did was design the outline of the sign using Inkscape, a vector graphics software.
